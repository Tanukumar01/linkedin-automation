# LinkedIn Automation Tool

A production-grade LinkedIn automation system built with **Go** and **Rod browser automation**, featuring sophisticated anti-detection mechanisms and clean, modular architecture.

##  Disclaimer

##  Features

### Core Functionality
- **Authentication System**: Secure login with session cookie persistence
- **Smart Search**: Search LinkedIn users by job title, company, location, and keywords
- **Connection Automation**: Send personalized connection requests with custom notes
- **Messaging System**: Automated follow-up messages with template support
- **State Persistence**: SQLite database tracks all activities and prevents duplicates

### Anti-Detection Mechanisms (10+ Techniques)

#### Mandatory Techniques
1. **Bézier Curve Mouse Movement**: Natural cursor paths with overshoot and micro-corrections
2. **Randomized Timing Patterns**: Variable delays, think time, and reading simulation
3. **Browser Fingerprint Masking**: Disables `navigator.webdriver`, randomizes viewport, masks automation properties

#### Additional Techniques
4. **Realistic Typing Simulation**: Variable speed, typos, corrections, natural pauses
5. **Natural Scrolling**: Acceleration, deceleration, scroll-back, random pauses
6. **Activity Scheduling**: Business hours operation, weekend detection, random breaks
7. **Rate Limiting**: Daily/hourly limits, cooldown periods, exponential backoff
8. **Mouse Hovering**: Idle cursor wandering, element hovering
9. **Viewport Randomization**: Dynamic viewport dimensions
10. **Human Reading Patterns**: Content-based reading time simulation

## Prerequisites

- **Go 1.21+** installed
- **Chrome/Chromium** browser installed
- LinkedIn account credentials

##  Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tanukumar01/linkedin-automation.git
   cd linkedin-automation
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit `.env` and add your credentials:
   ```env
   LINKEDIN_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
   LINKEDIN_PASSWORD=your-password
   LOG_LEVEL=info
   HEADLESS_MODE=false
   ```

4. **Customize configuration** (optional):
   Edit `configs/config.yaml` to adjust:
   - Search filters
   - Connection/message limits
   - Stealth settings
   - Message templates

##  Usage

### Run the bot:
```bash
go run main.go
```

### Build executable:
```bash
go build -o linkedin-bot main.go
./linkedin-bot
```

### Configuration Options

#### Search Filters (`configs/config.yaml`)
```yaml
search:
  filters:
    job_titles:
      - "Software Engineer"
      - "Senior Developer"
    companies:
      - "Google"
      - "Microsoft"
    locations:
      - "United States"
    keywords:
      - "golang"
      - "backend"
```

#### Connection Settings
```yaml
connections:
  daily_limit: 20          # Max connections per day
  hourly_limit: 5          # Max connections per hour
  note_templates:
    - "Hi {{firstName}}, I came across your profile..."
```

#### Stealth Settings
```yaml
stealth:
  timing:
    action_delay_min: 2    # Minimum delay between actions (seconds)
    action_delay_max: 5    # Maximum delay between actions (seconds)
  
  scheduling:
    business_hours_start: 9
    business_hours_end: 18
    timezone: "America/New_York"
```

## 🛡️ Anti-Detection Strategy

### How It Works

1. **Human-like Mouse Movement**
   - Uses Bézier curves for natural cursor paths
   - Random overshoot and micro-corrections
   - Variable speed with acceleration/deceleration

2. **Timing Randomization**
   - Random delays between all actions
   - Think time before interactions
   - Reading time based on content length

3. **Browser Fingerprinting**
   - Masks `navigator.webdriver` property
   - Randomizes User-Agent strings
   - Injects realistic browser properties

4. **Activity Patterns**
   - Operates only during business hours
   - Takes random breaks
   - Varies daily activity timing

5. **Rate Limiting**
   - Conservative daily limits (default: 20 connections/day)
   - Cooldown periods between actions
   - Exponential backoff on errors

##  Database Schema

The tool uses SQLite to track:
- **Connection Requests**: Profile URL, name, status, timestamps
- **Messages**: Sent messages with content and timestamps
- **Search Results**: Cached profiles with metadata
- **Activity Logs**: All actions for auditing

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Go not found**:
```bash
# Install Go from https://golang.org/dl/
# Verify installation:
go version
```

**Browser not found**:
- Ensure Chrome/Chromium is installed
- Rod will attempt to download Chromium if not found

**Login fails**:
- Verify credentials in `.env`
- Check for 2FA/CAPTCHA (manual intervention required)
- Review logs for specific error messages

**Daily limit reached**:
- Adjust `daily_limit` in `configs/config.yaml`
- Wait 24 hours for limit reset

##  Logging

Logs are output to stdout with configurable levels:
- `debug`: Detailed debugging information
- `info`: General information (default)
- `warn`: Warning messages
- `error`: Error messages

Set log level in `.env`:
```env
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```
